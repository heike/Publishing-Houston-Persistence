  abstract = {An automated approach for evaluating the strength of the evidence of firearm toolmark comparison results is presented for a common source scenario. First, comparison scores are derived describing the similarity of marks typically encountered on the primer of fired cartridge cases: aperture shear striations as well as breechface and firing pin impressions. Subsequently, these scores are interpreted using reference distributions of comparison scores obtained for representative known matching (KM) and known non-matching (KNM) ballistic samples in a common source, score-based likelihood ratio (LR) system. We study various alternatives to set up such an LR system and compare them using qualitative and quantitative criteria known from the literature. As an example, results are applied to establish a system suitable for a firearm-ammunition combination often encountered in casework: Glock firearms with Fiocchi nickel primer ammunition. The system outputs an LR and a measure of LR uncertainty. The range of possible LR-values is limited to a minimum and maximum value in areas of the score domain with little reference data. Finally, the feasibility of combining LRs of different mark types into one LR for the entire primer is assessed. For the distribution models considered in this paper, different modeling approaches are optimal for different types of similarity scores. For the chosen firearm-ammunition combination, non-parametric Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) models perform best for similarity scores based on the correlation coefficient, whereas parametric models perform best for the Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) scores, assuming binomial and beta-binomial models for KM and KNM score distributions respectively. Finally, it is demonstrated that individual LRs of different mark types can be combined into one LR, to interpret a set of different marks on the primer as a whole.},

The position and shape information of the striae on the bullet land is represented by a feature profile, which is used for determining the CMS number automatically. Rapid counting of CMS number provides a basis for ballistics correlations with large databases and further statistical and probability analysis. Experimental results in this report using bullets fired from ten consecutively manufactured barrels support this developed model.},

Empirical validation of the method is established through experiments based on tool marks made at selected fixed angles from 50 sequentially manufactured screwdriver tips. Results obtained from three different comparison scenarios are presented and are in agreement with experiential knowledge possessed by practicing examiners. Further comparisons between scores produced by the algorithm and visual assessments of the same tool mark pairs by professional tool mark examiners in a blind study in general show good agreement between the algorithm and human experts. In specific instances where the algorithm had difficulty in assessing a particular comparison pair, results obtained during the collaborative study with professional examiners suggest ways in which algorithm performance may be improved. It is concluded that the addition of contextual information when inputting data into the algorithm should result in better performance.},

  abstract = {Forensic toolmark comparisons are currently performed subjectively by humans, which leads to a lack of consistency and accuracy. There is little evidence that examiners can determine whether pairs of marks were made by the same tool or different tools. There is also little evidence that they can make this classification when marks are made under different conditions, such as different angles of attack or direction of mark generation. We generate original toolmark data in 3D, extract the signal from each toolmarks, and train an algorithm to compare toolmark signals objectively. We find that toolmark signals cluster by tool, and not by angle or direction. That is, the variability within tool, regardless of angle/direction, is smaller than the variability between tools. The known-match and known-non-match densities of the similarities of pairs of marks have a small overlap, even when accounting for dependencies in the data, making them a useful instrument for determining whether a new pair of marks was made by the same tool. We provide a likelihood ratio approach as a formal method for comparing toolmark signals with a measure of uncertainty. This empirically trained, open-source method can be used by forensic examiners to compare toolmarks objectively and thus improve the reliability of toolmark comparisons. This can, in turn, reduce miscarriages of justice in the criminal justice system.},

New metrics based on CMPS scores are introduced and compared with existing metrics. A measure called sum of squares ratio is included, and how it can be used for evaluating different scans, metrics, or parameters is showcased with the Hamby study data sets. An open-source implementation of the CMPS algorithm makes the algorithm more accessible, generates reproducible results, and facilitates further studies of the algorithm such as method comparisons.},

We provide methods to identify parameters that minimize error rates for matching of LEAs, and a remedial algorithm to alleviate the problem of failed tests, while increasing the power of the test and reducing error rates.

The Type I and Type II error rates are 7.2\% (6105 out of 84,235) and 21.4\% (271 out of 1256), respectively.

  abstract = {A bullet signature measurement system based on a stylus instrument was developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the signature measurements of NIST RM (Reference Material) 8240 standard bullets. The standard bullets are developed as a reference standard for bullet signature measurements and are aimed to support the recently established National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The RM bullets are designed as both a virtual and a physical bullet signature standard. The virtual standard is a set of six digitized bullet signatures originally profiled from six master bullets fired at ATF and FBI using six different guns. By using the virtual signature standard to control the tool path on a numerically controlled diamond turning machine at NIST, 40 RM bullets were produced. In this paper, a comparison parameter and an algorithm using autoand cross-correlation functions are described for qualifying the bullet signature differences between the RM bullets and the virtual bullet signature standard. When two compared signatures are exactly the same (point by point), their cross-correlation function (CCF) value will be equal to 100\%. The measurement system setup, measurement program, and initial measurement results are discussed. Initial measurement results for the 40 standard bullets, each measured at six land impressions, show that the CCF values for the 240 signature measurements are higher than 95\%, with most of them even higher than 99\%. These results demonstrate the high reproducibility for both the manufacturing process and the measurement system for the NIST RM 8240 standard bullets.},

In current practice, firearms examiners inspect cartridge cases for ``sufficient agreement,'' in which case they conclude that they come from the same gun, testifying in courts as such. A 2016 President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology report questioned the scientific validity of such analysis (President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, Washington, DC, Executive Office of the President). One recommendation was to convert firearms analysis to an objective method. We propose a fully automated, open-source method for comparing breechface marks on cartridge cases using 2D optical images. We improve on existing methodology by automating the selection of marks, and removing the effects of circular symmetry. We propose an empirical computation of a ``random match probability'' given a known database, which can be used to quantify the weight of evidence. We demonstrate an improvement in accuracy on images from controlled test fires.},

The cross-correlation maximum is the functional parameter used to quantify similarity. A second parameter, called the relative profile (2D) difference or relative areal topography (3D) difference, may also be used to quantify differences and to recognize the ambiguous condition when two results have different vertical (z-) scales but identical shapes. Most of these examples have been applied in support of ballistics inspection methods in crime labs, but the methods are generally useful for estimating the accuracy of surface replication techniques or the ability of different surface topography instruments to measure the same surface and provide the same result. The instruments used in these studies were a stylus instrument and a Nipkow-disk type confocal microscope. Cross-correlation functions may also be used to assess differences resulting from the use of different filters to modify the same surface profile or topography image.},
